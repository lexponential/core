Data-Driven Language Learning.

Instructions to future Luke:
- make sure webpack, flask, and flask_sqlalchemy are installed
- in a python interpreter run

    from server import db  
    db.create_all()

- start the server with 'python server.py' (make sure it's serving on port 5000 - otherwise login won't work)
- in the static directory you'll need to run webpack
